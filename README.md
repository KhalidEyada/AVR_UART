# AVR_UART
ART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) Driver for AVR Microcontrollers
UART

Overview
The UART Driver for AVR Microcontrollers enables easy communication with other devices or peripherals using the UART protocol. UART is a widely used asynchronous serial communication protocol that allows bidirectional data transfer between two devices. This driver simplifies the setup and handling of UART communication, making it ideal for various applications like interfacing with sensors, GPS modules, Bluetooth modules, and more.

Key Features
Configuration: The driver provides functions to set up the UART baud rate, data frame format (e.g., data bits, stop bits, parity), and other communication parameters.

Transmit and Receive: Easily send and receive data using the UART interface with simple write and read functions.

Interrupt Support: The library supports UART interrupts, allowing non-blocking communication and efficient use of processor resources.

Blocking and Non-blocking Modes: Choose between blocking and non-blocking UART communication based on your application's requirements.

Sample Applications: Well-documented sample applications demonstrate different UART communication scenarios, including polling and interrupt-driven modes.

Installation
To incorporate the UART Driver into your AVR project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code.
Copy the relevant driver files (uart.c and uart.h) into your project directory.
Include the uart.h header file in your application code.
Usage
Using the UART Driver involves the following steps:

Initialize the UART: Call the initialization function to configure the UART communication settings, such as baud rate and data frame format.

Transmit Data: Use the provided write functions to send data over UART.

Receive Data: Utilize the read functions to receive incoming data from the UART interface.

Interrupt Usage (Optional): If desired, configure UART interrupts for non-blocking communication.

Contributions to the UART Driver for AVR Microcontrollers are welcome! If you encounter any issues or have improvements to suggest, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on the GitHub repository.

License
The UART Driver for AVR Microcontrollers is licensed under the MIT License, making it suitable for both personal and commercial projects.

Note: Ensure that the UART settings (baud rate, data frame format) on both sides of communication are matched for reliable data transfer. Consider using voltage level shifters if interfacing with devices that operate at different voltage levels.
